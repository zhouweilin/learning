`PV(page view)` refers to a number of pages which are viewed or clicked,which is a measure for visitor volume on the site.To be specific, PV value 
is that all visitors view how many pages or how many times in one site in 24 hours(from 0 point to 24 point).PV is a times to refresh page,one PV

recorded for again in the same day.UV provides a index to count visitors during a given time,not total activity in the site.

`IP` could be understood as visitor with unique IP referring to a number to visit site with unique IP in the one day,regardless of how many pages it 
visits with same IP,number of IP is 1.If it assumed that there is one IP in two PC,which recorded as one visit.
